# NumTy Core

The fundamental package for scientific computing with Typescript or Javascript.
The main point of creation of this package is to have the similar functionality
like Python guys have thanks to [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).


In the Core package you will find basic array creation and manipulation operators and mathematical functions.

## Credits
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for the greatest inspiration
* [sentdex ](https://www.youtube.com/c/sentdex) for great lessons on Python and data analysis.


## Running unit tests

Run `nx test core` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
