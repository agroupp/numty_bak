/**
 * Compares two numbers and returns an integer that indicates whether the current

 *
 * @param n1 number to compare
 * @param n2 number to compare
 * @returns
 * A value that indicates the relative order of the objects being compared.
 * The return value has these meanings:

 * Value              |	Meaning
